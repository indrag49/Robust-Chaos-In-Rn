# Robust-Chaos-In-Rn

This is a code repository accompanying our paper: Indranil Ghosh and David J.W. Simpson, "[Robust chaos in ℝⁿ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22563)".

- The Jupyter notebook [Robust Chaos In R^n](https://github.com/indrag49/Robust-Chaos-In-Rn/blob/main/Robust%20Chaos%20in%20R%5En.ipynb) consists of Python codes to create the figures in the manuscript, except Figs 3 and 4.
- Figs 3 and 4 can be generated using the Matlab files "pp3d.m" and "pp19d.m" from files "pp_3D.csv" and "pp_10D.csv" respectively.
